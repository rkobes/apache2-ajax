This module is a mod_perl2 interface to CGI::Ajax,
which provides a mechanism for using perl code
asynchronously from javascript-enhanced HTML pages.
See the documentation for Apache2::Ajax for details.

As well as mod_perl2, the package requires CGI::Ajax, 
as well as a CGI.pm-compatible
CGI module for supplying param() and header() methods.
If available, CGI::Apache2::Wrapper will be used,
which is a minimal module that uses methods of mod_perl2
and Apache2::Request to provide these methods; if this
is not available, CGI.pm (version 2.93 or greater) will be used.

Installation proceeds through the usual
   perl Makefile.PL
   $MAKE
   $MAKE test
   $MAKE install
or, if Module::Build is available,
   perl Build.PL
   perl Build
   perl Build test
   perl Build install
A ppm package for Win32 users of ActivePerl 8xx can be installed
by adding http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/ppms/ to your list
of repositories and then issuing the command
   C:\> ppm install Apache2-Ajax
